# The easiest way to do this is by changing the IFS variable we saw in Chpater 4.

# This sets the IFS to be a colon, which is the separator used in PATH. The for loop
# loops through, setting dir to each of the colon delimited fields in PATH. ls is used to print
# out the directory name and associated innformation. The -l parameter specifies the "long"
# format and the -d tells ls to show only the directory itself and not its contents.

# In using this you might see an error generated by ls saying, for example,
# ls: /usr/TeX/bin: No such file or directory. It indicates that a directory in PATH
# doesn't exist. We can modify the listpath script to check the PATH variable for
# nonexistent directories by adding some of the tests we saw earlier:

# Refer to listpath-V2
