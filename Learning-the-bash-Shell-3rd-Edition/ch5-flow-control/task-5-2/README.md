$ Task 5-2

<a id="e-start"></a>[__*Beginning -- "Learn the bash shell 3rd edition, O'REILLY (Chapter 5. Flow Control)"*__](#e-end)

Task 4-4 used pattern matching and subsitution to list the directories in `PATH`, one to a line. Unfortunately, olf versions of bash don't have that particular pattern operator. Write a general shell script, listpath, that pritns each directory in `PATH`, one per line. In addition, have it print out information about each direcotry, such as the permissions and the modification times.
